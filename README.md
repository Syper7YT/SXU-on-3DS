# SXU-on-3DS
I took free time to port Sonic Extreme Unity on 3DS to understand how the engine works on the hardware.
I don't Know if Ill update it because its an old project and i want to work on my own games to learn more

New 3DS runs fine
press X for an extra level
OLD 3DS crashes and Frame rate is poor
    - the frame rate can be fixed it just takes a lot time, there are a lot of geometry that you can't see and a lot of draw calls that can be optimized
